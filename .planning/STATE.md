# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-11)

**Core value:** On stage, the presenter starts an Orbis-Stable session seeded from a sanitized family photo, narrates the memory, and steers the live-generated video in real time via prompt updates — proving "photo → living, steerable memory" works as a demo.
**Current focus:** Reconcile roadmap/requirements against actual implementation (see Repo Migration note below) before resuming phase-by-phase execution.

## ⚠️ Repo Migration (2026-09-12)

This `.planning/` directory was copied over from the original prototype repo
(`/Users/romy/Documents/GitHub/_prototypes/family_videos_memories`) into
`orbis-hackathon-starter` (this repo, branch `family-video-memories`), where the app itself was
already migrated in commit `45e5a91` ("Migrate Family World: Video Memories app onto the starter")
and has continued to move forward here since:

- `bd5e016` — Add leningrad and phnom_penh video assets
- `6c20374` — Add "Explore Grandma's World" page with memory video gallery
- `d6fd194` — Fix infinite redirect loop on auth error page
- `088bc6b` — Add homepage nav link to Explore Grandma's World

**ROADMAP.md/REQUIREMENTS.md below predate a direction pivot** documented in
`spikes/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md` (spikes 004-011, 2026-09-11): the project moved from a single live
Orbis-Stable steering demo (the literal 3-phase roadmap) to a broader "Family World" product —
FamilyGallery, WorldProvider architecture, composite worlds (Cavite City / Phnom Penh / Leningrad),
a creation screen, and now a public gallery page ("Explore Grandma's World") — none of which is
reflected in ROADMAP.md's phase checkboxes or REQUIREMENTS.md's checklist. Inspection of the
migrated code confirms substantial Phase 1/2 functionality already exists (server-side JWT minting
in `app/api/reactor/token/route.ts`, image-seed pipeline + live steering UI in
`ViskoOrbisStableApp.tsx`/`app/lib/visko.ts`), but this has **not been verified item-by-item**
against REQUIREMENTS.md's checkboxes.

**Recommended next step:** run `/gsd-progress` (or `/gsd-resume-work`) to reconcile ROADMAP.md and
REQUIREMENTS.md against the real codebase state before planning new phases — do not assume Phase 1
is still "not started" as the stale fields below still say.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Auth + Seed-Contract Spike) — **stale, predates pivot; needs reconciliation**
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Needs reconciliation (see Repo Migration note above)
Last activity: 2026-09-12 — Completed quick task 260912-mlm: Fix /live-world?memoryId=<id> not running and the broken live-session layout

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Orbis-Stable's seed contract confirmed image-only (no video seed) — reshapes Phase 1 to skip a video-seed spike entirely.
- Pre-roadmap: Voice-to-prompt (live ASR) is out of scope — presenter types/selects prompts instead.
- Roadmap: 3-phase structure adopted directly from research's suggested ordering (Auth/Spike → UI → Hardening), matching coarse granularity.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Exact per-second Orbis-Stable billing rate and Nebius credit allotment for this event are unconfirmed — verify at on-site check-in, may cap how much steering stress-testing is affordable.
- Phase 1: Confirm exact current SDK method names/shapes at build time — the CLI resolves templates live from GitHub's default branch and may have shifted since research was captured 2026-09-11.
- Phase 3: Cold-start GPU latency (minutes on first connect) means the live session must be warmed up 15-20 minutes before the 5:00 PM presentation slot, not cold-connected on stage.

Stopped at: `.planning/` migrated into orbis-hackathon-starter (this repo). ROADMAP.md/REQUIREMENTS.md are stale relative to the actual implementation and the documented direction pivot (see Repo Migration note above) — reconciliation not yet performed.
