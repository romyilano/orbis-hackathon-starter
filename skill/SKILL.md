description: Extend this cloned Visko Orbis Stable example app — add new controls, scenes, knobs, image flows, or features on top of `@reactor-models/visko-orbis-stable` (^2.0.1) without breaking the patterns the existing code already uses. Covers the SDK's connection / events / messages model, the phase-based UI architecture, the state snapshot pattern, per-chunk (mid-stream) prompt morphing, the explicit setImage→image_accepted→setPrompt→start chain for image-to-video (this model has NO atomic setConditioning), resolution / audio / seed session knobs, the curated scene library, and prompt design rules for smooth continuous video generation.

# Building on this Visko Orbis Stable app

You've cloned this folder and now you want to extend it — a new control, a new scene, a new model knob, a different UX. This guide explains the patterns the existing code uses and the rules to follow so your additions feel native instead of bolted on.

All the code referenced below already exists in this folder. Read this guide alongside the source.

## What Visko Orbis Stable actually is, in three sentences

Visko Orbis Stable is a **continuous, steerable** video generation model — the lightweight tier of the Visko Orbis family. Once it starts generating, it produces an unending stream of video on `main_video` (plus a real `main_audio` track — 48 kHz mono, chunk-aligned). You steer the scene mid-stream by changing the prompt, which the model picks up **at the next chunk boundary** (~1.8 s) — morphing the picture instead of cutting.

The frontend's job is to (a) start the generation, (b) keep the user steering it, and (c) gracefully reflect the model's state.

## The four concepts you'll touch

| Concept        | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                      | Hook / API                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Connection** | The lifecycle of the model session (`disconnected → connecting → waiting → ready`; plus `pending` (SR-priming after start) and `capacity` (429 pod-busy, auto-retried — NOT a real disconnect)) | `useViskoOrbisStable().status`, `.connect()`, `.disconnect()`                                                                                                                        |
| **Events**     | Things you send TO the model. Always async.                                                                                                                                                     | `useViskoOrbisStable().setPrompt({...})`, `.setImage({...})`, `.setSeed({...})`, `.setResolution({...})`, `.setAudioEnabled({...})`, `.start()`, `.pause()`, `.resume()`, `.reset()` |
| **Messages**   | Things the model sends BACK to you — including the all-important `state` snapshot.                                                                                                              | `useViskoOrbisStableState((m) => …)`, `useViskoOrbisStableCommandError`, `useViskoOrbisStableImageAccepted`, etc.                                                                    |
| **Tracks**     | `main_video` (rendered) + `main_audio` (a real audio track, mixed into the same view).                                                                                                          | `<ViskoOrbisStableMainVideoView audioTrack="main_audio" />`                                                                                                                          |

You almost never have to drop below this surface. If you find yourself reaching for `@reactor-team/js-sdk` directly, stop and re-read the typed hooks list — there's likely a typed hook you're missing. The one documented exception is the recording surface (`SnapClip`), a base-SDK feature the typed packages deliberately do not re-export.

**Naming note:** the typed hooks are long — `useViskoOrbisStableState` (the snapshot), `useViskoOrbisStableGenerationStarted`, and so on. That's mechanical from the model name; there is no shorter alias. Everything below abbreviates to `useVisko…` in prose but the code uses the full names.

## The runtime reality (measured — drive your UX from this, not from hope)

These come from the model's own schema doc-comments and the productize hand-off. They are **behaviour**, not config intent — encode them in your UI instead of being surprised:

- **Startup is minutes.** One live session per deployment; the SR model compiles, then the model runs **three warmup chunks** before it answers commands. `StatusBadge` labels `waiting` honestly rather than spinning a mystery. A crashed/hard-exited client can hold the pod as a "zombie" until the reaper frees it (~1–2 minutes — one empirical data point, N=1); retries there are cheap, don't treat it as "the example is broken".
- **The first chunk emits ZERO frames** (`frames_emitted: 0` — SR priming). First picture lands ~2 chunks / ~3.7 s in. Don't surface chunk 1 as an error; hold a "priming" state (the `Video` overlay + `StatusBadge` both do). **Caveat:** on a warm run the whole window can pass in under a second-poll, so describe it in copy as _something you may briefly see_, not a guaranteed always-visible state — clients who never spot it should not think the stream is stuck.
- **A 429 is CAPACITY, not a disconnect.** The deployment holds one live session; when it's busy the API returns `429 no available capacity`. The SDK collapses this into `disconnected` + a transient error, so a naive UI reads "broken" exactly when the pod is just busy. `StatusBadge` detects the capacity message in `lastError`, shows a dedicated "At capacity — retrying…" state, and **auto-retries with backoff** (a crashed/zombie session frees the pod in ~1–2 minutes). Don't ever surface raw 429s as plain `disconnected`.
- **Generation resolution ≠ delivery resolution.** The model generates at 832×480; the delivery stage upscales to the picked tier (e.g. `1080p / 2k / 4k`). The resolution picker changes the delivered raster, NOT what the model invents. The `SessionOptions` panel says this out loud.
- **THE HERO — prompts are PER-CHUNK, and CONFIRM the morph.** `set_prompt` mid-run morphs the scene at the next chunk boundary. Observable confirmation is a first-class need, not a nicety — a morph that doesn't visibly land in one chunk reads as "didn't work". `EvolveScene` shows a pending state until `prompt_accepted` lands; `NowPlaying` stamps "morphed @ chunk N". Don't just assert the morph fired; let the client verify it.
- **Command lifecycles differ.** Get these right or your UI lies:
  - `set_prompt`, `set_image` → per-session inputs; do NOT survive `reset`.
  - `set_resolution`, `set_audio_enabled`, `set_seed` → **read once when `start` fires**, apply at the NEXT start, and **survive `reset`**. A running generation keeps what it started with — its track geometry never jumps mid-shot.
- **`generation_complete` returns to WAITING, no auto-restart.** A new run begins at chunk 0, which is a hard cut, so the model won't issue one unasked. The client must send `start` (same conditions) or `reset` first. `NowPlaying` renders the "Run finished" CTA for exactly this.
- **Non-16:9 images squash.** The reference image is resized to 832×480 with no crop. `ImageStarter` warns inline.
- **Don't set `set_audio_prompt` from a scene description.** Measured to make audio WORSE than unset (unset = sound from the picture alone). `AudioPanel` deliberately has no audio-prompt box and says why.

## The UI phase model

A real-time video session is a state machine. This app maps it to **two visible UI phases**, and each component self-selects:

```
       ┌──────────────┐    setPrompt + start    ┌────────────────┐
       │  WAITING     │ ──────────────────────▶ │   GENERATING   │
       │  (Setup UI)  │ ◀───────────────────────│   (Live UI)    │
       └──────────────┘          reset          └─────┬──────────┘
                                                     │ ▲
                                                pause│ │resume
                                                     ▼ │
                                                ┌────────────────┐
                                                │     PAUSED     │
                                                │   (Live UI)    │
                                                └────────────────┘
  (generation_complete → back to WAITING; the client must start again)
```

| UI phase  | When                                                                      | What's visible                                                                                        | What's hidden            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Setup** | `snapshot.started === false` (or no snapshot — fresh page / disconnected) | StatusBadge · CommandError · prompt presets · image picker · session options (resolution/seed/audio)  | NowPlaying · EvolveScene |
| **Live**  | `snapshot.started === true` (running OR paused)                           | StatusBadge · CommandError · NowPlaying (Pause/Resume/Reset + done-CTA) · EvolveScene (live steering) | setup controls           |

Components self-hide via early returns on the snapshot. No orchestration logic in the parent — adding a new component means dropping it into the sidebar and putting the right early-return at its top.

### When you add a new control, decide its phase first

- **Knob that primes a session** (seed, resolution, audio-enabled) → **Setup** phase; but it's fine to leave it visible mid-run as long as the copy says "applies at next start" (that's what `SessionOptions` / `AudioPanel` do, since these values persist and arm future runs).
- **Knob that adjusts the live scene** (prompt morphs) → **Live** phase. Early-return when not started.
- **Always-on** (status, clip capture) → no early return; gate interactivity on `status === "ready"`.

```tsx
// Setup-phase component
if (status === "ready" && snapshot?.started) return null;

// Live-phase component
if (status !== "ready" || !snapshot?.started) return null;
```

The `status === "ready"` half matters — without it, your component shows stale data from the previous session after a disconnect/reconnect.

## Auth — no-store route + a resolver that memoizes

Two pieces work together: `app/api/reactor/token/route.ts` mints a session-scoped JWT server-side, and `<ViskoOrbisStableProvider jwtToken={fetchToken}>` hands the SDK a resolver it calls on every Reactor API hop.

### `jwtToken` takes a resolver

`jwtToken` accepts a `JwtSource` — a static string or a function returning `Promise<string>`. Pass the resolver. The SDK re-invokes it on uploads, clip manifests, ICE refresh, and SDP renegotiation, so a token aging out mid-session can't 401 those hops; a static string caches one value at construction and breaks the moment it expires.

The provider stabilizes the resolver internally, so the inline arrow form is safe — a parent re-render does **not** tear the session down. Do not wrap it in `useCallback`.

### The token must stay stable for a session's whole life

This is the rule everything else follows from. Reactor binds a session to the exact token that created it: a scoped token may act only on sessions it created itself. Hand a later hop a freshly minted JWT and it answers

```
403 this token is session-scoped and is not authorized for this resource
```

So the resolver has to return the *same* token across every hop of one session. It does that by memoizing in module scope, in `app/ViskoOrbisStableApp.tsx`: a `cachedToken` holding the JWT and its expiry, a one-minute refresh skew, and an `inflightToken` promise that coalesces the parallel hops the SDK fires at connect time into a single mint.

**Do not delegate that to the browser's HTTP cache.** It looks equivalent and is not: the cache may drop an entry whenever it likes (DevTools "Disable cache", ordinary eviction, a shared proxy), and the refetch that follows mints a token with no sessions bound to it — so the session that was working 403s on its next upload. This is why the route answers `Cache-Control: private, no-store` and the client fetches with `cache: "no-store"`.

### The route — `app/api/reactor/token/route.ts`

Already implemented. Why it's shaped this way, so you don't break it:

1. **Returns `{ jwt, expires_at }`.** `expires_at` is Unix seconds and comes from the server, which caps the lifetime it grants. Read it back rather than decoding the JWT in the browser; it is what lets the client memoize for exactly the real lifetime.
2. **`Cache-Control: private, no-store`.** The client owns the caching, in memory. `private` additionally keeps shared caches (CDNs, corporate proxies) from ever storing a per-user JWT.
3. **`authorization_details` scopes the token** to `reactor/visko-orbis-stable` with a bounded `max_sessions` budget. The browser's token can only create sessions for this model and act on sessions it created — a leaked token is a bounded loss, not an account key. Match the model by the account-qualified name the provider connects with; a scope that misses it mints fine and then 403s on `connect()`.
4. **The `REACTOR_API_KEY` never leaves the server.** The route reads it; the browser only ever holds the minted JWT.

That shape is the only auth model this example documents. Keep the key server-side and the resolver stable, and don't reach for a third-party identity provider here — a refreshed identity token has the opposite lifetime rule from a session-scoped one, and swapping one in breaks the binding above.

**One edge this does not cover:** a session created moments before the memoized token expires is orphaned at the next refresh, because the fresh token isn't bound to it. If you hit it, re-mint with `authorization_details.resources.sessions.bind` naming that session's id so the new token inherits authorization for it.

### autoConnect

Initialization is **without** `autoConnect` — the user clicks Connect to see the transitions (important here because `waiting` is minutes and must be labelled). For a polished product:

```tsx
<ViskoOrbisStableProvider
  jwtToken={fetchToken}
  connectOptions={{ autoConnect: true }}
>
```

Keep the honest `waiting` / `priming` labels if you do — sessions don't reach `ready` instantly.

## The state snapshot — your UI's single source of truth

The model emits a `state` message after every command and every chunk. Subscribe, hold it in `useState`, read fields off it. **Don't aggregate `chunk_complete` / `generation_started` / `generation_paused` to reconstruct state** — the snapshot already contains everything.

```tsx
const [snapshot, setSnapshot] = useState<ViskoOrbisStableStateMessage | null>(
  null,
);
useViskoOrbisStableState((msg) => setSnapshot(msg));
```

Fields you'll actually read:

| Field                      | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `started`                  | True once `start()` succeeded. Stays true through pause. Cleared by `reset()`. **The phase switch.**                    |
| `running`                  | True while actively producing frames. Equal to `started && !paused`.                                                    |
| `paused`                   | True after `pause()`, false after `resume()`.                                                                           |
| `current_prompt`           | The prompt driving generation, `null` before start. **Match against the scene library** to drive the steering UI.       |
| `current_chunk`            | Progress counter since reset / connect.                                                                                 |
| `has_image` / `has_prompt` | Whether the session has a reference image / prompt yet. (Note: `has_image`, not helios's `image_set`.)                  |
| `available_resolutions`    | The deployment's offered delivery tiers (e.g. `["1080p","2k","4k"]`). **Render the picker from this, never hard-code.** |
| `resolution`               | The delivery resolution the next `start` will use (fixed for a running generation).                                     |
| `audio_enabled`            | Whether the next `start` will generate sound (fixed for a running generation).                                          |
| `seed`                     | The session's current seed field. The seed actually driving a running run was captured at `start`.                      |

### Clear the snapshot on disconnect

The SDK does **not** emit a final `state` when the session ends. Without an explicit reset, the last snapshot lingers and your UI shows stale "still generating!" data after a reconnect. Every component that holds a snapshot does:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (status !== "ready") setSnapshot(null);
}, [status]);
```

Three lines, no abstraction.

### Coerce conservative schema types when rendering

The generated types are conservative — several fields are typed wider than the values you'll actually see (e.g. `string | null`, plus `unknown`-ish fields on some surfaces). Coerce at the render boundary:

```tsx
const prompt =
  typeof snapshot.current_prompt === "string" ? snapshot.current_prompt : "";
const res =
  typeof snapshot.resolution === "string" && snapshot.resolution
    ? snapshot.resolution
    : null;
const resolutions = Array.isArray(snapshot.available_resolutions)
  ? snapshot.available_resolutions.filter(
      (r): r is string => typeof r === "string",
    )
  : [];
```

The example does this everywhere it reads the snapshot. Do the same in new components.

### Acks arrive on the awaited call, not on a listener

A command's confirmation is **addressed**: the runtime sends each per-command ack — `prompt_accepted`, `image_accepted`, `resolution_accepted`, `audio_enabled_accepted`, `generation_paused` / `_resumed` — to the one connection whose command earned it, correlated by request id. So the awaited call *is* the ack:

```tsx
// ✅ tied to this call, and resolution means the handler finished
await sendSetPrompt(s, prompt);

// ⚠️ never fires for these acks — they are replies, not broadcasts
useViskoPromptAccepted(() => setMorphPending(false));
```

A listener on an ack still compiles and simply never runs, which is why `EvolveScene` and `NowPlaying` carry an explicit "INTENTIONAL SILENCE" comment where one would otherwise look missing. Drive the morph-pending state, the "morphed @ chunk N" stamp, and the I2V gate off the awaits, as the example already does.

What genuinely broadcasts to every connection is `state`, `chunk_complete`, `generation_started`, `generation_reset`, and `command_error`. That split is the rule for multi-client work: anything every client must agree on has to broadcast, and the `state` snapshot is what that is for. Never build shared UI state out of a command's reply.

Two corollaries worth holding on to:

- **Awaiting a command that answers with nothing is still a barrier.** The runtime acknowledges every correlated command once its handler has run, so a resolved await means the model is done. Delete any sleep that existed to "give the model time".
- **Commands never reject.** A refused command resolves `undefined` and the reason arrives as a `command_error` broadcast, so `try/catch` is not how you detect failure — test the resolved value.

## Sending events — the typed methods

Every command has a typed wrapper on `useViskoOrbisStable()`. Always `await` them; they return a Promise that can reject.

```tsx
const {
  setPrompt,
  setImage,
  setSeed,
  setResolution,
  setAudioEnabled,
  start,
  pause,
  resume,
  reset,
} = useViskoOrbisStable();

// Text-to-video
await setPrompt({ prompt: "A black volcanic coastline at golden hour…" });
await start();

// Steering mid-run — THE hero move
await setPrompt({ prompt: "The same coastline, a storm rolling in…" });

// Session knobs (apply at NEXT start, survive reset)
await setResolution({ resolution: "2k" }); // must be on available_resolutions
await setAudioEnabled({ audio_enabled: false }); // save compute; silence
await setSeed({ seed: 42 }); // reproducible

// Transport
await pause();
await resume();
await reset();
```

**No atomic `setConditioning`.** That's the Helios-0.9+ command. This model's image-to-video is `setImage` → `image_accepted` → `setPrompt` → `start` — see the next section.

**Never reach for `sendCommand("set_prompt", ...)` when a typed method exists.** You lose autocomplete and the param-name typo check.

### Status-gate every interactive control

Sending a command when `status !== "ready"` is a no-op with a console warning. Surface it as `disabled`:

```tsx
const { status, setPrompt, start } = useViskoOrbisStable();
const ready = status === "ready";
<button disabled={!ready || !text.trim()} onClick={...}>Start generating</button>
```

## Chaining commands for image-to-video — wait for `image_accepted`

This model has **no atomic `setConditioning`**, so an image-to-video launch is an explicit ordered chain. Commands that carry uploads (`setImage`) resolve slower than commands that don't (`start`); naive chaining races the model and the first chunk renders before the image lands (a visible flicker into the anchored composition).

**The pattern — park a one-shot resolver BEFORE `setImage`, then gate `start` on the ack:**

```tsx
const imageReadyRef = useRef<(() => void) | null>(null);

useViskoOrbisStableImageAccepted(() => {
  if (imageReadyRef.current) {
    imageReadyRef.current();
    imageReadyRef.current = null;
  }
});

async function startFromExample(scene) {
  const blob = await fetch(scene.imageUrl).then((r) => r.blob());
  const ref = await uploadFile(blob, { name: `${scene.id}.jpg` });

  const imageReady = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    imageReadyRef.current = resolve; // registered BEFORE setImage — can't miss the ack
  });

  await setImage({ image: ref });
  await imageReady; // ← gate on the ack
  await setPrompt({ prompt: scene.initial.text });
  await start();
}
```

This is the whole flow in `ImageStarter.startFromExample`. `uploadFile` returns a `FileRef`; the SDK lifts it into the uploads envelope, so `image: ref` reads as a regular field.

**Two launch paths in `ImageStarter`, two chains:**

- **Curated scene** (image + prompt known together) → the full `uploadFile → setImage → image_accepted → setPrompt → start` chain above.
- **Custom upload** → `uploadFile → setImage` only. The user types a prompt in `PromptComposer` and clicks Start; by then the human delay has covered the image processing, so no ack wait is needed in that path.

Prefer the specific `image_accepted` ack over `conditions_ready` — the latter fires per conditioning command with partial flags and makes predicate-matching finicky. The **text-only** path (`setPrompt → start`) never needs an ack — prompt updates are instant.

## Mid-stream prompt morphing — the signature capability

Once `started === true`, calling `setPrompt({ prompt })` is a **morph on the next chunk boundary** (~1.8 s) — no restart, no `start()` again, no cut. The scene continues from where it was.

`EvolveScene` is the canonical pattern: match `snapshot.current_prompt` against the scene library (which tracks `initial` + every `evolution`), render that scene's evolutions as click handlers that call `setPrompt` directly, plus a free-form morph box for prompts we don't recognise:

```tsx
const current =
  typeof snapshot.current_prompt === "string" ? snapshot.current_prompt : "";
const scene = findSceneForPrompt(current);
// … scene.evolutions.map(e => <button onClick={() => setPrompt({ prompt: e.text })}>{e.title}</button>)
```

**No `start()` in the click handler.** We're already generating; we're just swapping the prompt. The snapshot updates on the next chunk, the active evolution highlights, and the model morphs smoothly. Any new control that mutates the live scene follows the same rule — call the typed method, don't touch `start()`.

One typed subscription hook per message:

## Resolution / audio / seed session knobs

`SessionOptions` (resolution + seed) and `AudioPanel` (audio-enabled) are reference implementations. The shared rules:

- **Render options from live data.** The resolution picker maps over `snapshot.available_resolutions` (filtered to strings) — a deployment-configured list. If the deployment's menu changes, the picker follows; nothing is edited.
- **`set_resolution` validates against the deployment's list.** Passing a string not on `available_resolutions` produces a `command_error` naming the offered list — `CommandError` surfaces it for free.
- **Apply-at-next-start copy.** These values are read once when `start` fires. If the user changes them mid-run, the running generation keeps what it started with. Both panels say "applies at the next start" when `started === true`.
- **Seed semantics.** The model never draws its own seed — same seed + same prompts reproduces the same video. Default 42.

## audio — surface it, but carefully

`main_audio` is real (48 kHz mono, samples chunk-aligned with video — `chunk_complete.audio_samples` even equals `frames_emitted / fps * 48000` so you can check A/V alignment without decoding). But:

- **Playback rides the video element, unmuted.** `<ViskoOrbisStableMainVideoView audioTrack="main_audio" />` mixes both tracks into one MediaStream on the SDK's `<video>` (when `audioTrack` is set, the SDK default is `muted={false}`). Sound plays automatically in the common case precisely because starting a run always goes through a click (a preset or "Start generating") — that's the user gesture autoplay policies need. The one blocked path (a restored/autoplayed session with no gesture) shows a "Tap to enable audio" button that unmutes + re-plays `onClick` — never leave the stream silently muted with no affordance. Do NOT bind `main_audio` to a second hidden `<audio>` element: it double-plays and gives no unmute UI.
- **Give the client a way to VERIFY the audio is live.** If a client hears nothing, the Tap-to-enable button is the only answer they have — and it's a guess. `NowPlaying` surfaces a "🔊 audio on" / "🔇 audio off" indicator (track attached + not muted) + the session's `audio_enabled` state, so a silent stream has a visible explanation (audio model off for the run vs. the browser just needs a tap) instead of a mystery. Document the check; don't leave audio liveness to the client's ear alone.
- **`set_audio_enabled` is a compute toggle.** Off = the audio model is skipped, `main_audio` carries silence, chunks are cheaper. A client that never wants audio can also omit `main_audio` from its track mapping at connect time — that needs no command but still spends compute; `set_audio_enabled(false)` is how the compute is actually saved.
- **Console noise is (mostly) benign — and the docs should say so.** During warmup you'll see repeated `ICE candidate error: RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent` pairs, and at the connect→frames boundary an `Auto-play failed: AbortError` or two. Both are self-recovering in the SDK and read to a client as "broken" if unexplained. The long-term fix is to quiet them in the SDK itself (filed separately, not patchable per-example); until then, the Quick-start notes these red lines are expected while the badge still says "Starting up".

## The scene library — one source, three surfaces

All suggested prompts live in `app/lib/prompts.ts`. Each scene is a world with an arc:

```ts
export interface Prompt {
  title: string;
  text: string;
}
export interface Scene {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  initial: Prompt;
  evolutions: ReadonlyArray<Prompt>;
  imageUrl?: string; // present on image-backed scenes; absent = text-to-video
}

export const SCENES: ReadonlyArray<Scene> = [
  /* ... */
];
export const TEXT_SCENES = SCENES.filter((s) => !s.imageUrl);
export const IMAGE_SCENES = SCENES.filter(
  (s): s is Scene & { imageUrl: string } => !!s.imageUrl,
);
export function findSceneForPrompt(prompt) {
  /* matches initial OR any evolution */
}
```

The library feeds three surfaces:

- `PromptComposer` reads `TEXT_SCENES` → renders `initial` of each as a clickable card (text-to-video, no image needed).
- `ImageStarter` reads `IMAGE_SCENES` → renders thumbnails and ships the image bytes from `/public/images/` (image-to-video).
- `EvolveScene` calls `findSceneForPrompt(snapshot.current_prompt)` → renders that scene's `evolutions` as one-click morphs.

**Adding a new scene = one entry in `SCENES`.** No component changes. If it has an `imageUrl`, drop 16:9 bytes into `public/images/`.

### Prompts must be full paragraphs, and evolutions must re-establish the world

This is the most underrated part of building a real-time video frontend, and the #1 reason scenes look choppy when they should be smooth.

**Each prompt is a paragraph**, not a tagline. Setting, subject, light, motion, AND the camera shot, all named. Terse prompts ("a castle in the sky") force the model to invent the rest every chunk and the picture drifts.

**Each prompt is ONE continuous take.** No cuts, no montage, no scene lists. The model generates a single unbroken shot per prompt.

**Each evolution re-establishes the SAME setting/subject BEFORE the change.** That's what makes the mid-run morph read as cinematography instead of a glitch:

```
Initial:    "A majestic citadel of pale stone floats above an ocean of
             cloud… golden light breaks across the towers… slow cinematic
             aerial drift… a single unbroken take."

Evolution:  "The same floating stone citadel above the cloud ocean, the
             same slow aerial drift. A vast thunderstorm is rolling in —
             towering charcoal clouds, lightning in the cloud mass below,
             the golden light turning cold…"
```

The setting and camera are restated **verbatim**; only the conditions (weather / time / light) shift. That stability is what produces smooth on-screen continuity.

### UI for long prompts

Render only the short `title` as the button label, `line-clamp-2` over the dim `text` beneath. The full paragraph reaches the model on click; truncation is purely visual.

## Capturing clips

Recording is base-SDK and model-agnostic — the same `SnapClip.tsx` ships across every example. `requestClip(seconds)` asks for the trailing N seconds, `<ClipPlayer>` previews it, `<ClipDownloadButton>` saves an MP4.

This is the **one place** in the app where importing from `@reactor-team/js-sdk` directly is idiomatic rather than a smell. The typed package carries `requestClip` and `downloadClipAsFile` on its hook, but deliberately re-exports none of the components or `RecordingError`, because none of them depend on model identity. The rule for anything else you add: if it needs this model's events, messages, or commands, it comes from the typed package; if the same code would work against any model, the base SDK is fine.

The shape, in five parts:

1. Gate on `status !== "ready"` and return `null`, so the panel self-hides with the session and needs no phase awareness — it sits at the bottom of the sidebar.
2. Read `requestClip` off `useReactor((s) => s.requestClip)`. `useReactor` works inside the typed provider because that provider wraps `<ReactorProvider>` internally.
3. Catch `RecordingError` and surface `code` / `reason` inline. Its typed reasons are `DISCONNECTED`, `RECORDER_DISABLED`, `INVALID_DURATION`, and `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`.
4. Compose the modal from `<ClipPlayer>` and `<ClipDownloadButton>`, both of which take `onError` / `onSuccess`. They operate on a `Clip` value alone, so the modal survives a disconnect.
5. No `getJwt` plumbing — the clip components inherit the resolver from the provider through React context. The exception is a portal rendered outside the provider subtree (a toast in `app/layout.tsx`), where you capture the resolver with `reactor.getJwtResolver()` at action time and thread it down.

`hls.js` is a direct dependency, not a peer: `<ClipPlayer>` plays HLS natively on Safari and dynamically imports `hls.js` everywhere else. Without it the preview surfaces an inline error and downloads still work.

For a whole session rather than a trailing window, `reactor.requestRecording()` is the counterpart, and `useClipDownload` is the headless hook if you want your own download UI. Either way, **clip URLs are short-lived** — a few minutes. The downloaded file is the artifact; the URL is not something to share or persist.

## Brand alignment — design tokens, not components

The app pulls Reactor's design tokens from `@reactor-team/ui/styles.css` (loaded in `app/layout.tsx`) but does **not** import its React components (they use hooks and would force `"use client"`). Tailwind aliases in `app/globals.css` expose `bg-brand`, `text-brand`, `text-brand-fg`, `bg-active`, `text-active` as plain utilities — usable in Server or Client Components. Reach for actual UI components only when you need their behavior (e.g. a copy-on-click code block), and those usages are Client Components anyway.

## Common mistakes when extending

1. **Reaching for `@reactor-team/js-sdk` directly** for a Visko-specific event/message. Everything is on the typed package; the only allowed exception is the recording surface.
2. **Aggregating events to reconstruct state.** Read the snapshot. Stop folding `chunk_complete` + `generation_started` into your own flags.
3. **Chaining `setImage + setPrompt + start` without the `image_accepted` gate.** `start` slips past the in-flight upload and the first chunk renders unconditioned. Gate on `image_accepted` (parked BEFORE `setImage`), or use text-only `setPrompt → start` (instant, no ack needed).
4. **Surfacing `frames_emitted: 0` on chunk 1 as an error.** It's SR priming; the first picture is ~2 chunks in. Hold a priming state instead.
5. **Hard-coding the resolution list.** Render from `snapshot.available_resolutions`. Also remember it's an upscaler tier (832×480 → delivered raster), not the generation size.
6. **Assuming resolution/audio/seed apply immediately.** They're read at `start`. Mid-run changes arm the NEXT start — and they survive `reset`. Prompt + image don't.
7. **Auto-restarting after `generation_complete`.** The model returns to WAITING on purpose (a new run is a hard cut). Show a "Start again" CTA; don't fire `start` from an effect.
8. **Setting an audio prompt from the scene description.** Measured worse than unset. `AudioPanel` has no audio-prompt box on purpose.
9. **Forgetting to clear the snapshot on disconnect.** Three lines of `useEffect` per snapshot-holding component, every time.
10. **A non-16:9 reference image.** It squashes to 832×480 with no crop. Keep curated images 16:9; warn on custom upload.

## Checklist for new components

Before merging a new control or feature:

- [ ] Decided which phase it lives in (Setup, Live, or always-on)
- [ ] Early-return at the top matches that phase
- [ ] If it subscribes to `useViskoOrbisStableState`, it clears on disconnect via `useEffect`
- [ ] Snapshot reads are coerced (`typeof x === "string" ? x : …`, `Array.isArray(...)`, `.filter((r): r is string => …)`)
- [ ] All interactive controls gate `disabled` on `status === "ready"`
- [ ] All event calls use typed wrappers (`setPrompt`, not `sendCommand`) and are `await`ed
- [ ] I2V launch chains `uploadFile → setImage → image_accepted → setPrompt → start` with the resolver parked BEFORE `setImage`
- [ ] Live-scene mutations call the typed method with NO `start()`
- [ ] Renders `command_error` (the existing `CommandError` handles it — don't suppress)
- [ ] New prompts in `app/lib/prompts.ts` are full paragraphs, one continuous take, evolutions re-establish the world
- [ ] Resolution / audio / seed controls use "applies at next start" copy when `started === true`
- [ ] Brand colors via Tailwind tokens, not hardcoded hex
- [ ] No `@reactor-team/js-sdk` / `@reactor-team/ui` React imports unless required (recording is the documented exception)
