       * Header scrolls out of view with the sidebar; video and controls
       * stay in frame as you scroll the page. CSS structure:
       *   - root:  flex/h-screen at lg+, regular block flow below
       *   - main:  lg:h-full + lg:overflow-hidden so its children don't
       *            grow the row

       *            independently of the video, no "sticky" hack
       *   - Video: aspect-video + max-h-full so it letterboxes inside the
       *            pane (no top/bottom bars) instead of stretching tall
       *
       * Mobile (below lg) keeps normal page-scroll: everything flows in
       * order, video on top (order-first).

           * the hero surface and must be visible immediately, not pushed
           * below 500px of setup panels. `order-first`/`lg:order-none`
           * on the section swaps the visual order without changing the
           * DOM order, so keyboard/screenreader navigation still goes
           * through the controls before the video. (Desktop layout lives
           * on the outer div above — lg:h-screen/h overflow-hidden on this
           * root+main pair keeps the desktop page fitted while mobile
           * stays standard page-scroll.)
