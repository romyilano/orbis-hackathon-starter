// Browser-local handoff between the "Add Family" intake flow and a live
// Orbis session. /add-family runs the photo through groundFamilyMemory()
// (memory-pipeline.ts) at save time — restoring/reframing it (Nano Banana)
// and grounding an Orbis prompt in it (Gemini) — and stores the grounded
// result here, keyed by photo id. MemoryAutostart (see
// app/components/MemoryAutostart.tsx) reads it back from the `?memoryId=`
// query param and just starts the stream: no more Gemini calls needed at
// that point.
//
// Scoping decision: family worlds stay browser-LOCAL — the photo bytes are
// never uploaded to our server — but a saved memory must survive a new tab,
// a reopened link, and a closed tab, not just the one tab that created it
// (a shared/reopened `/live-world?memoryId=` link is the whole point of the
// feature). That rules out sessionStorage, which only survives the tab that
// wrote it — the earlier choice here is exactly what broke a reopened link.
// localStorage is the right lifetime instead. A cross-DEVICE share still
// cannot work (nothing is stored anywhere but this device) — that's accepted
// for this demo, not a bug, and MemoryAutostart's "missing" copy says so
// honestly.
//
// localStorage is ~5MB per origin, and the record used to carry the raw
// uploaded photo (`image`) as well as the restored `anchorImage` — two
// base64 data URLs. Only the anchor is needed to run the world, so
// saveFamilyMemory strips `image` before writing; AddFamily's own
// thumbnails read component state (`p.src`), not the store, so nothing on
// screen regresses.
